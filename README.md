# Docker Lab & PoC Validation: React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182)

> **Disclaimer:** This repository and its PoC artifacts are created strictly for educational, research, and defensive security demonstration purposes within an isolated lab environment. Unsanctioned testing against external systems is strictly prohibited.

---

## 1. Project Governance & Authorization Boundary

### Project Purpose
This repository provides a reproducible, dual-container Docker environment designed to analyze, exploit, and validate mitigations for the React Server Components (RSC) Flight Protocol Deserialization vulnerability (popularly referenced as **React2Shell** / **CVE-2025-55182**). The lab demonstrates post-exploitation impact on an unpatched Next.js build and proves mitigation efficacy on a patched build.

### Target
- **In-Scope Targets:**
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3001` (`react2shell-vulnerable` container)
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3002` (`react2shell-patched` container)
- **Out-of-Scope:** Any external domain, public network interface, host machine operating system, or cloud infrastructure.

### Lab Safety Controls
- **Network Isolation:** All containers run within a private Docker bridge network with outbound internet routing disabled (`internal: true`).
- **Loopback Binding:** Exposed ports are strictly bound to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) to prevent external LAN accessibility.
- **Dummy Secrets:** Simulated credentials (`DUMMY_SECRET=LAB_VULNERABLE_SECRET_DO_NOT_USE_12345`) are utilized for exfiltration testing to eliminate sensitive data exposure.

## 2. Environment Setup & Operational Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** (Engine `24.0.0+`, Compose `v2.20.0+`)
- **Python** (`3.8+` — Standard library only for base automation)
- **cURL** (WSL, Linux, or PowerShell built-in)

### Installation
Clone the repository and verify your local environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmit-nct/React2Shell.git
```
### Lab Startup
Navigate to the lab/ directory and initialize both dual-build containers:
```bash
cd lab
docker-compose up -d --build
cd ..
```
### Vulnerability Detection
Run the detection scanner in both labs:
#### 1. Scan the patched lab 
```bash
python src/react2shell_scanner.py lab/patched
```
#### 2. Scan the vulnerable lab
```bash
python src/react2shell_scanner.py lab/vulnerable
```

### Lab Stop
```bash
cd lab
docker-compose stop
cd ..
```

### Dynamic Exploitation & Validation (PoC)
To execute the exploit validation tests and verify exfiltration artifacts, please refer to the detailed step-by-step PoC guide:

## 3. Dependencies, Lockfile Format & Version Rules

### Dependency Matrix
| Target Service | Framework / Package | Installed Version | Lockfile Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vulnerable Target (`:3001`)** | Next.js | `15.0.0-rc.1` | `package-lock.json` (Lockfile Version 3) |
| | React / React-DOM | `19.0.0-rc-65a56d0e-20241020` | NPM Registry Release |
| **Patched Target (`:3002`)** | Next.js | `15.0.3` (Stable) | `package-lock.json` (Lockfile Version 3) |
| | React / React-DOM | `19.0.0` (Stable) | NPM Registry Release |

### Lockfile Selection & Version-Rule Sources
- **Selected Lockfile Format:** NPM `package-lock.json` (v3 format). The static scanner prioritizes parsing the resolved dependency tree inside `packages["node_modules/next"]` for accurate detection.
- **Version-Rule Sources:** Rule definitions for CVE-2025-55182 are derived from official Next.js Security Advisories, marking all Next.js versions `< 15.0.3` (including `15.0.0-rc` builds) as vulnerable to RSC Flight Protocol deserialization.

### PoC Source & Reference Commit
- **PoC Source:** Derived from public research on React Server Components (RSC) Flight Chunk Deserialization Gadgets.
